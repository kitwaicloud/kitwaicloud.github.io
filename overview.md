# Overview

This instruction manual provides a guideline how to perform tasks on KitWai platform ranging from starting, using and terminating a Spark cluster. Although we use python and Jupyter notebook as the main tools to give illustrative examples, other tools and programming language can still be used if needed.

In a Spark cluster, several python packages are already installed, including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc. There exist Java and Scala compilers available too.
